# obsidian-qualitative-analysis-environment
This is a forked version of [this environment9(https://github.com/ryanjamurphy/obsidian-qualitative-analysis-environment). However, I do things slightly differently in my environment. I do not use links below an interview file, but right in the middle of the text. It also works great and is more precise.

It works like this: Create a link with `[[` where a code should be linked. It can be in multiple places. Then you can populate the code with a brief description of what it is, and in the right extra panel, you have all links to key passages. Additional helpful quotes in the description of the code itself are optional.

I also suggest dividing the codes slightly differently. I only use codes for brief, fleeting codings, and memos for more advanced thoughts. Codes can "upgrade," as it were, but sometimes I start with a memo right away, because I know it's key. More info on this setup is in the `readme` folder, which also includes the original readme of the environment.

# A Qualitative Analysis environment for Obsidian

![13c5a16a-c509-4554-ac86-293bc0eb441c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3618647/129074558-65de7de2-a0df-4a7f-bc00-97b806409f70.png)

This environment supports qualitative analysis of text (and potentially other media) with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). It is an example of an [Integrated Thinking Environment](https://axle.design/obsidian-roam-and-the-rise-of-integrated-thinking-environmentsâ€”what-they-are-what-they-do-and-what-s).
